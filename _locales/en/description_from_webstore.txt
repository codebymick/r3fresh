r3fresh your chrome url without effort. Anytime the source file changes Chrome browser will monitor the change and refresh automatically...

Free version is out there to share the love and keep it open source...
Paid version is available for those in believe it's good to support a poor and hungry fledging developer....HELP!

Be sure to enable "monitor entire domain" in options...

Features:
  * Entire domains can be r3freshed
  * file:// protocol is now supported

It's recommended you use this extension only in a local development environment and not in a production environment.
